            <p>The Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed in the
                 United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the teaching of basic 
                 computer science in schools and in developing countries.  The original model 
                 became far more popular than anticipated, selling outside its target market 
                 for uses such as robotics. It does not include peripherals (such as keyboards, 
                 mice and cases). However, some accessories have been included in several official 
                 and unofficial bundles. 
                According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, over 5 million Raspberry Pis were sold 
                by February 2015, making it the best-selling British computer.  By November 2016 
                they had sold 11 million units, and 12.5m by March 2017, making it the third 
                best-selling "general purpose computer".  In July 2017, sales reached nearly 
                15 million.  In March 2018, sales reached 19 million.
